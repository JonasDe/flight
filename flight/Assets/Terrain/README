How to generate heightmaps for terrain generated with Blender:

 - Open the .blend file for the heightmap you want
 - Render the texture
 - Save to file (as PNG)
 - Open in Gimp, export as Raw (.data)
   - Use Planar (RRR/GGG/BBB) setting when asked
 - Import .data file in terrain asset
   - It will ask for a .raw, but the .data is in the correct format.
 - Use the TerrainToolkit to smooth it (the leveling issue has an unknown cause, could be due to Gimp not handling 16bit raw exports)
